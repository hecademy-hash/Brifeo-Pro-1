> **The Ultimate Orchestrator & Project Manager**

Welcome to **El DT** (The Director Técnico). This project serves as a central command center for orchestrating workflows, managing tasks, and ensuring your team plays like champions.

## 🚀 Overview

**El DT** is designed to bring order to chaos. Just like a football manager on the sidelines, this tool helps you:
- **Orchestrate** complex workflows.
- **Manage** project tasks and timelines.
- **Direct** your development strategy with precision.

## 📂 Documentation & Security

We take security seriously. All sensitive documentation is kept out of the repository.

### handling Sensitive Data
If you need to add sensitive configuration or documentation:
1. Navigate to the `docs/` folder.
2. **DO NOT** commit files with real secrets.
3. Use `docs/SENSITIVE_DATA_TEMPLATE.md` as a guide.
4. Any file in `docs/` is ignored by default, *except* for templates.

## 🛠️ Getting Started

1. **Clone the repo**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Mazalucas/El-DT.git

2. **Setup Environment**
